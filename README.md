[00:02.46] In the corners of my mind
[00:04.56] I just can't seem to find a reason to believe
[00:08.84] That I can break free
[00:11.59] 'Cause you see, I have been down for so long
[00:15.55] Feel like all hope is gone, but as I lift my hands
[00:19.90] I understand that I should praise you through my circumstance
[00:50.40] 
[00:24.72] Take the shackles off my feet, so I can dance
[00:29.45] I just want to praise you
[00:32.09] I just want to praise you (just want to praise you)
[00:35.66] Take the shackles off my feet, so I can dance (I can lift my hands)

[00:54.26] I just want to praise you (praise you)
[00:57.77] You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands (I can lift my hands)
[01:02.63] And I'm gonna praise you
[01:05.22] I'm gonna praise you
[01:15.22] 
[01:08.91] In the corners of my mind
